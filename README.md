# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

To work on this course project, you need to download the run_analysis.R and the data for the project (available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). First, unzip the file and put the folder UCI_HAR_Dataset into your R working directory. After run the source code, it will generates a file called "tidy_data.txt" in your working directory.

Dependencie: This R program needs the "data.table" and "reshape2" packages installed on your environment.
